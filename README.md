## How To Play
Run Quake 4. If using my shortcut, skip to the next step. On the main menu, find the Mods button and select the 'mod' option. Allow the game to restart.

Start a new game, load a save, or use the `map` command to load a specific map.

Open console (`ctrl+alt+~` or just `~` if using my shortcut) and type the `class` command followed by the class you would like to choose (pyro, demo, heavy, sniper, spy). The name of the class is not case sensitive.

> Example! Do `class pyro` to get access to Pyro's default loadout of a custom Flamethrower as primary and Shotgun as secondary.

Use whatever keys you have bound to weapon fire and zoom in order to use the custom weapons. Check in-game help (`tf2help`) to have this info while playing.

### Help info:
Try `tf2help <class>` for more specific help on each class.
To change your class, type the `class` command followed by the class you would like to choose (pyro, demo, heavy, sniper, spy)

#### Pyro Class
Pyro starts out with a flamethrower as his primary weapon and a shotgun as a secondary.

_Custom flamethrower_: hold your weapon fire keybind (probably left click) to douse enemies in flames.

This weapon deals big damage but has limited range. When an enemy is set on fire, they will continue to take burning damage for a short time.

#### Demoman Class
Demoman begins with a rocket launcher as his primary weapon and a stickybomb launcher as a secondary.

_Custom stickybombs_: press your weapon fire keybind (probably left click) to shoot a kind of grenade that sticks to any surface it touches.

You can then press your zoom keybind (probably right click) to activate all armed stickybombs simultaneously.

These stickybombs deal less damage than normal grenades, but provide a large boost to the player, with a \"small\" penalty of taking damage yourself.

#### Heavy Class
Heavy starts out with a minigun as his primary weapon and a shotgun as a secondary. He is slower than other classes.

_Custom minigun_: hold your weapon fire keybind (probably left click) to spin up the drum. When it gets up to speed, the gun will shoot quickly.

You can also hold your zoom keybind to just spin up the drum without shooting any bullets. This prevents the long delay in firing, but will slow you down the whole time.

This weapon deals big damage but has poor accuracy and slows down the player significantly while the drum is spinning.

#### Sniper Class
Sniper starts out with a sniper rifle as his primary weapon and an SMG as a secondary.

The rifle deals lots of damage when aimed well, and is intended for use at long range. Unfortunately, even the SMG isn't great for short range fighting.

#### Spy Class
Spy starts out with a revolver as his primary weapon and can turn invisible.

_Custom revolver_: This gun only has 6 shots before needing to reload, but is perfectly accurate when shooting at slower intervals.

If spamming the weapon fire key, shots will scatter much more inaccurately. Wait for a bit longer than 1 second between shots to guarantee accuracy.

This weapon deals good damage and perfect accuracy when shots are carefully chosen.

_Custom ability_: Spy is able to turn invisible for a short time by pressing your zoom keybind (probably right click). Enemies will not be able to see you.
