## How To Play
Open console (`ctrl+alt+~` or just `~` if using my shortcut) and type the `class` command followed by the class you would like to choose (pyro, demo, heavy, sniper, spy). The name of the class is not case sensitive.

> Example! Do `class pyro` to get access to Pyro's default loadout of a custom Flamethrower as primary and Shotgun as secondary.

Use whatever keys you have bound to weapon fire and zoom in order to use the custom weapons. Check in-game help (`help `)to learn how to use each weapon.
